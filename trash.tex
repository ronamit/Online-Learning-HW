 \begin{itemize}
    \item Uses Stochastic Mirror Descent (SMD)  (generalizes SGD)[The alg doesn't know the objective func, but has access to stochastic gradient oracle]
There is well known guarantee for SMD
     \item Write the algorithm from Jin20 , only for DMDP case.
     \item There is well known guarantee for SMD (as we seen in class), but we also need to show how to derive a policy and what its guarantees in the original RL problem. 
 \end{itemize}
